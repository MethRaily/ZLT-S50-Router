Target Device: Tozed/ZLT S50 



Configuration Version: 3.0.13 



Carrier Profile: SC001 (Safaricom) 



File Format: XTCF (Encrypted Tozed Configuration File) 


Technical Description
This is a specific carrier-level update file designed to push configuration changes to a ZLT S50 device already running the SC001 profile. It uses the proprietary XTCF format, which is an encrypted binary blob.



Encryption & Security: The file begins with the XTCF magic header. It is encrypted to prevent manual tampering and is designed to be decrypted only by the router's internal configloader utility.




Model Validation: The configloader binary contains strict logic to verify the customer_code and model_code (e.g., TZKW0000) within these files. If you attempt to upload this to a different hardware revision, the router will reject it with a 9003 error.

Purpose: This file likely contains updated network parameters, such as:

APN Settings: Specific access point names for Safaricom data services.

TR-069 ACS URL: The address for the carrier's Auto-Configuration Server.


Band Locking: Preferred LTE/WCDMA frequencies optimized for the SC001 network.

Usage & Troubleshooting

Application: This file is typically pushed via an ACS (like GenieACS) or uploaded through the "Config Update" section of the router's web interface.


Verification: The configUpdate.js file indicates that after a successful upload, the system may require a reboot and can trigger a RESTORE_DEFAULT command to apply the new settings.


Integrity: If the file size or checksum is incorrect, the configloader will report that it "fail to parse xtcf file".

Warning
Because this file is tied to the SC001 customer profile, applying it to a router with a different profile (like a standard Airtel or Dialog variant) may lock the device to Safaricom settings or cause a configuration mismatch.
