README: ZLT S50 Configuration Export File
File Overview

File Name: cfg_export_config_file.conf 


Target Device: Tozed/ZLT S50 (Dialog Axiata variant) 


File Type: Encrypted Binary/Configuration Blob 


Source Path: Typically exported from /tzwww/cfg_export_config_file.conf via the web management interface.

Technical Description
This file is an encrypted export of the router's internal configuration database. It is generated and processed by the system's configloader and configmaker utilities.


Encryption: The file content is obfuscated/encrypted using system-level libraries (likely libcmdlib.so utilizing Blowfish or AES). It is not human-readable in its raw state.



Contents: When decrypted by the device, it contains critical system parameters, including:


Login Credentials: Super Admin (gztzadmin), Senior, and User passwords.


Network Locks: LTE band masks (USR_LTE_LOCK_BAND_MASK), PCI locks, and operator-specific restrictions.


Carrier Profiles: Customer-specific identifiers like SC001 (Safaricom) or AE001 (Airtel).


Usage & Troubleshooting
Restoration: This file is intended to be used with the "Restore Configuration" feature in the Web UI.

9003 Error: Attempting to upload a config file from a different model (e.g., X21G) onto an S50 will result in a 9003 Invalid Arguments error. The configloader utility verifies the customer_code and model_code (e.g., TZKW0000) before processing the file.


Security: Because this file contains sensitive data like the SYS_SUPER_LOGIN_PWD, it should be handled securely and not shared publicly.

Developer Notes
To analyze the plain-text variables within this config, one would typically need to intercept the temporary shell scripts generated by configloader in the router's /tmp/ directory (e.g., .rc.other.conf) during a boot sequence or configuration apply event.
